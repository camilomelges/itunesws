# ITunesWs

    - I created the WS service using search end-point from itunes-api, so the filter can be sent only in a string, like in a google search.

    - The Ws don't have the filter by music, so users have to inform "jack johnson musics" for example, else return all data related to jack johnson!

    - Each service have its README.md

    - Each service has been tested
        - Coverage of savedatapi Classes 100%, Methods 73% and Lines 83%.
        - Coverage of itunesws -> Classes 92%, Methods 91% and Lines 90%.

    - All properties of spring are configurable with JAVA ENVS.
